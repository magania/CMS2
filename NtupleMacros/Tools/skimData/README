#files need to be changed: allSkim.sh (you need to specify datasets, the input and the output directories) and ntupleFilter.cc (you need to specify your analysis skim selections)
#files don't need change: makeSkim.C and checkAndRunSkim.sh
#how to run: source allSkim.sh & 
# The skimming is run in a looper, which is awoke every 7200 seconds. This deals with the rolling-in data files. You can only stop the looper when 
# you are sure that the dataset is complete and no more files are rolling in.
