    * Todo: remove 2012 trigger and selections

26-09-2011 - Frank Golf
	* tagged with FakeRates26September2011v2
	* added branches for number of L1FastL2L3 PF jets with pt > 30 (40) GeV
	* added branch for evt_rho
	* update on-th-fly JEC files; now read files from CORE; read different files for data and MC for PF jets
15-09-2011 - Frank Golf
	* tagged with FakeRates15September2011
	* added status 3 MC matching information for FOs
	* added non-truncated PF isolation for cone sizes 0.3 and 0.4
	* changed interface to set good run list; it's no longer hard coded; now, there is a method SetGoodRunList that you need to call; if you run on data and don't set a good run list, it will crash;  if this is problematic, I can make it configurable so that ou don't have to set a goodrun list
	* also, remember that to run with on-the-fly JEC, you need to copy NtupleMacros/WW/files to the fakeRate/ directory
